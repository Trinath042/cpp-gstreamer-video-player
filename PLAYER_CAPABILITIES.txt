MyVideoPlayer POC Capabilities:

- Built on GStreamer playbin for streaming video playback.
- Supports HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), MPEG DASH, etc.
- Allows live switching of audio and subtitle tracks via console commands.
- Handles basic buffering and low-latency tuning.
- Monitors pipeline bus for errors, state changes, and end-of-stream.
- Clean architecture with main loop, async input handling, and safe cleanup.
- Easily extensible to add DRM decryptor elements for Widevine / PlayReady.
- Can be extended with custom video/audio sinks targeting Smart TVs or consoles.
- Basic demonstration; production-level features (security, UI, codecs) would require additions.
